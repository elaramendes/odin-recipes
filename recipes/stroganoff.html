    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I created this beef stroganoff recipe with hamburger because I love the taste of a good stroganoff, but I don't like the
        expense of beef tips, steak, or roast beef, nor do I like all the time it takes to make them. My version is creamy and
        tastes great.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can chopped mushrooms, with liquid</li>
        <li>1 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>Â½ cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet
            firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and
            crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir in cream cheese, mushrooms with liquid, and gravy mix; cook
            and stir over medium heat until cream cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Add condensed soup, sour cream, and milk; cook,
            stirring occasionally, until smooth and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Drain egg noodles; stir into the beef mixture. Cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
